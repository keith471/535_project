- if I attach R1 to R2, do I need to add a Link to the link array for both R1 and R2?
- confirm `start` protocol
- Let's presume I am trying to run start() and send out hellos to all routers that R1 is connected to
	- Trying to figure out how to deal with client threads. When I create a connection from R1 to R2, should I use a blocking socket connection and wait until the exchange is over to proceed (e.g. to making the next connection, say from R1 to R3? - i.e. should the hellos be concurrent or sequential)?
	- How long are socket connections meant to remain open?
		- the whole time would be nice, but then how do you sync up with another thread from the main thread and tell it to execute a HELLO or something?
	- one option, instead of doing things sequentially, might be to create two different client threads, one that knows the client process for a handshake, and another that knows the client process for communicating an LSAUPDATE, and we could just spawn a batch of these threads to run concurrently every time we want to do a handshake or send out an LSAUPDATE
- what's the difference between a router's rd and the RouterDescription r1 of its links. These can't always be in sync because of the status field... Don't get why we have both.
- in SOSPFPacket, what is public short srcProcessPort;?
	- we don't know what the source process port is, since it is assigned by the system (unless we are talking about the fake ports corresponding to the indices of the Link array of a router)
	- also, what is routerID in this class? And neighborID, isn't that the same as srcIP? Can we go through the fields?
- how do you send and receive SOSPFPackets rather than Strings?
